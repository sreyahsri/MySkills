Event Management System using Spring MVC.

The application aims to provide a comprehensive platform for event organizers to manage and promote various types of events, such as conferences, workshops, concerts, and exhibitions.
Key features of the system include:
1. Event creation
2. Attendee registration
3. Ticketing
4. Payment integration
5. Event scheduling
6. Attendee management.

The project will involve designing a flexible and scalable architecture using Spring MVC, integrating with a database to store event details, user information, and ticketing data. 
Implement advanced features like email notifications, social media integration for event sharing, real-time updates, and personalized user experiences. 
Additionally, incorporate role-based access control, allowing event organizers to manage their events, while attendees can view and register for events based on their interests.

Further, 
1. Spring Security for authentication and authorization
2. Spring Data JPA for database access
3. Thymeleaf for creating an engaging user interface.

By building this Event Management System, my proficiency in utilizing Spring MVC to create a robust and feature-rich web application is depicted.
